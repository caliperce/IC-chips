## 1. Problem Statement

Factories buy lots of IC chips from many suppliers. Each chip has tiny top markings (like device code, date/lot, sometimes a logo). Right now, QA staff only check a few chips by hand using OEM PDFs. This means counterfeits or re-marked parts can slip through, causing failures and delays.

**Goal:**  
Build an agent that reads a chip image, finds the correct OEM marking info, and outputs a verdict with evidence.

---

## 2. What Does a Good Solution Look Like?

- Take a photo of the chip’s top (phone or line camera is fine).
- Agent reads the image (no external OCR needed for this prototype).
- Extract visible text/logo.
- Figure out likely brand/MPN.
- Fetch the OEM datasheet section that defines the top-marking for that package.
- Compare what’s on the chip vs. what’s expected.
- Return one of: **PASS / FAIL / REVIEW / INDETERMINATE**  
  (plus a short explanation, parsed fields, and citations to the OEM source).

---

## 3. How the Agent Works (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Image Analysis & OCR
- **Input:** One or more top-view photos of IC chip
- **Extract:**
  - ALL visible text lines from chip surface
  - Logo (if present) - identify brand marker (ON, TI, Winbond, etc.)
  - Package type from physical appearance (DIP/SOIC/QFN/TSOP/QFP/etc.)
- **Output format:** `{"logo": "ON", "lines": ["4N35", "V1089"], "package": "DIP-6"}`

### Step 2: Brand & Device Identification
- If logo detected → map to OEM:
  - ON → onsemi
  - TI → Texas Instruments
  - Winbond logo → Winbond
  - ST → STMicroelectronics
- First text line is usually device code/part number
- Generate candidate list of OEM+MPN combinations
- Keep multiple candidates if ambiguous (e.g., LM324N made by TI/ST/onsemi/UTC)

### Step 3: Datasheet Search (Multi-Stage)

**Stage 3a: Primary Search**
- Query: `"{OEM} {device_code} datasheet marking diagram"`
- Restrict to OEM domain (e.g., onsemi.com, ti.com, winbond.com)
- Look for: PDF datasheet links, product pages

**Stage 3b: Marking-Specific Search**
- Query: `"{OEM} {device_code} package marking {observed_pattern}"`
- Include observed secondary markings in query (e.g., "V1089")
- Look for: marking diagrams, date code formats, assembly codes

**Stage 3c: Packaging Guidelines**
- Query: `"{OEM} packaging labeling guidelines date code"`
- Find: Company-wide marking standards (often PDF documents)
- These contain universal date code formats (YYWW, AWLYWW, VXYYD, etc.)

**Stage 3d: Community/Support Resources**
- Query: `"{OEM} date code marking {device_code}"`
- Check: community.onsemi.com, e2e.ti.com, support forums
- Often contain real-world examples and clarifications

**Fallback Search Strategies (if primary OEM datasheet not found):**
1.Try alternate OEM domains (.cn, .jp, regional sites)
2. Search distributor datasheets (mouser.com, digikey.com, newark.com)
3. Check datasheet archives (alldatasheet.com, datasheetarchive.com)
4. Look for cross-reference/equivalent parts from other manufacturers 

**If marking pattern unclear:**
1. Search: `"{device_code} marking code"` (generic)
2. Search: `"{OEM} date code format"` (company-wide standards)
3. Check technical notes: `"{OEM} AND* date code"` (application notes)
4. Search forums: `"identify {device_code} marking"`

### Step 4: Pattern Extraction & Validation

**From Datasheet/Documentation, extract:**
- Exact device marking (e.g., "LM324N", "4N35", "25Q64FVSIG")
- Date code format pattern (e.g., YYWW, VXYYD, AWLYWW)
- Field definitions:
  - Y/YY = Year (1-digit or 2-digit)
  - W/WW = Work week (01-53)
  - A = Assembly site
  - V = Version/Option code
  - D = Die/Lot/Assembly code
  - X = Year digit
- Package code mapping (e.g., TI: P=PDIP, D=SOIC; Winbond: SS=SOIC-8 208-mil, ST=VSOP-8, DA=PDIP-8)

**Validate observed markings:**
- Device code matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Date code length matches pattern
- Week number in valid range (01-53)
- Year digit is numeric
- All alphanumeric characters match expected charset

### Step 5: Cross-Reference Checks

- **Package consistency**: Physical package matches datasheet package code
- **Logo requirement**: Check if OEM explicitly requires logo on package
- **Optional fields**: Identify which marking fields are optional vs. mandatory
- **Assembly codes**: Validate assembly/site codes against known OEM facilities
- If brand is unknown but the marking matches any OEM's rule for that generic part, mark PASS (generic) with a note

### Step 6: Confidence Scoring (Internal Only)

Internally assign confidence based on:
- Datasheet availability: +40%
- Device code exact match: +20%
- Date code format valid: +15%
- Logo present (if expected): +10%
- Package type matches: +10%
- All fields parse correctly: +5%
**Thresholds (use to determine verdict):**
- 90-100% → Authentic
- 70-89% → Authentic
- 50-69% → Review Required
- <50% → Indeterminate or Counterfeit

### Step 7: Generate Final Output

⚠️ **AFTER YOUR INTERNAL ANALYSIS, OUTPUT ONLY THIS FORMAT:**

```

- ❌ Confidence scores
- ❌ Tables
- ❌ Parsed fields
- ❌ Expected vs. Observed comparisons

## 4. What the Agent Checks (General Rules & Example References)

**General Rules (Apply to Any Brand/Part):**
- **Device string:** Must match the datasheet’s stated top-side/device marking for that package.
- **Date/lot formats:** Accept the specific pattern the OEM defines (e.g., YYWW, VXYYD, AWLYWW, YYWWNNN). Validate digits/lengths/ranges.
- **Package sanity:** The physical body (DIP/SOIC/etc.) must agree with the orderable code (e.g., TI P=PDIP, D=SOIC; Winbond SS=SOIC-8 208-mil).
- **Logos:** Helpful cue; treat as optional unless explicitly required by the OEM.
- **If the datasheet is missing:** Try another likely OEM of the same generic part; if still missing, return INDETERMINATE with what was tried.

**Example OEM References:**
- **Texas Instruments — NE555 / LM324:**  
  TI’s Package Option Addendum lists Part/Device marking per package (e.g., NE555P for PDIP; SOIC entries differ; LM324N for PDIP-14).
<!-- - **onsemi — 4N35 optocoupler:**  
  Marking Diagram shows: ON logo + 4N35 + pattern V X YY D (V=option, X=year digit, YY=work week, D=assembly code). -->
- **Winbond — W25Q64FV serial flash:**  
  Datasheet table “Valid Part Numbers and Top-Side Marking” maps orderables (e.g., W25Q64FVSSIG) to abbreviated on-package text 25Q64FVSIG; also defines package codes (SS=SOIC-8 208-mil, ST=VSOP-8, DA=PDIP-8, etc.).
- **Microchip — 24LC256 EEPROM:**  
  Package Marking Information: first line part code; second line YY/WW/NNN (year/week/traceability). Use those patterns for regex checks.
